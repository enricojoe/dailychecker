## lib/pq: array columns and TIME scanning

- **Context:** Go + sqlx + `github.com/lib/pq` against PostgreSQL (DailyChecker M1 repositories).
- **Mistake:** A repository used `pq.Int64Array` for an `int[]` column (`days_of_week`) but never imported `github.com/lib/pq`, breaking the build (`undefined: pq`). Separately, `SELECT *` into structs with a `time`/`TIME` column scanned ambiguously under lib/pq's TIME→`time.Time` handling.
- **Correct Pattern:**
  - When using `pq.Int64Array` / `pq.StringArray` for Postgres array columns, import `github.com/lib/pq` and tag the field, e.g. `DaysOfWeek pq.Int64Array \`db:"days_of_week"\``.
  - Avoid `SELECT *`; list explicit columns. For `TIME` columns scanned into a string, cast in SQL: `time_of_day::TEXT AS time_of_day`. This sidesteps lib/pq's TIME→`time.Time` scan ambiguity.

## golang-migrate runner: don't let m.Close() kill the app pool

- **Context:** Programmatic golang-migrate runner sharing the application's `*sql.DB`.
- **Mistake:** Passing the live `*sql.DB` into the migrate instance meant `m.Close()` could close the connection the rest of the app relies on.
- **Correct Pattern:** Have the migration runner take the `databaseURL string` and open its own short-lived `*sql.DB` for the migration, then close that — never the caller's pool. Provide both `RunMigrations` (up) and `RunMigrationsDown` (down).

## Integration tests need the DB on the right host port

- **Context:** DailyChecker dev Postgres remapped from host port 5432 → **5433** (5432 occupied by an unrelated local container).
- **Correct Pattern:** `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env`/`.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml` all target 5433. Test helper auto-loads `backend/.env` via `godotenv` so integration tests actually run (not silently skipped). Bring the DB up with `make db-up` (or `docker compose up -d`) before `go test ./...`.
